Dear reviewer

This is the coding challenge as part of the myEdOnline application process.

I will be honest, it is true that I have done a few parsing and displaying of JSON files in a few exercises/projects at Le Wagon, but they did not put a lot of emphasis on it and it was done using Ruby as well. It was more about using the tools as opposed to learning the fundamentals. As a result, I am not 100% comfortable with what I have done here. However, as I mentioned on my initial email and what I said to Rhiannon, I genuinely love this and I am always studying new things each day as I am doing with my course right now (average 5-6 hours a day). I believe that not knowing something is not a failure. Refusing to find out and learn and giving up - this is what I would call a failure.

My point is that while my answer may not be satisfactory, I can demonstrate that I am always willing to learn and I sincerely mean it. If there is something I do not understand yet, I promise you I will learn it and grasp it completely.

Thank you and I do appreciate your time for reading my readme. While waiting for your response, I will no doubt be immersing myself in learning non-stop - I just want to get better and keep learning.

I look forward to hearing good news from you

Edward
